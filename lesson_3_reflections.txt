Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

A: When you are not working on your computer and want to do some work without
cloning the repository. Or to make a change you don't want in your computer at
that moment.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: Because, maybe there is a problem on the repository and you are not working
on it, or you don't want to see a new feature until you finish your work.
