Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

A: When you are not working on your computer and want to do some work without
cloning the repository. Or to make a change you don't want in your computer at
that moment.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: Because, maybe there is a problem on the repository and you are not working
on it, or you don't want to see a new feature until you finish your work.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

A: I would use fork to work in someone else's project where I don't have
permission to work, clone on my repositories and branch when I want to do
something in my own repository like an experiment.

Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

A: To know what is in the remote and merge if you need to.

Q: How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

A: Sending the code by email, or using a cloud. Nothing is easier.

Q: When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than
directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

A: When I'm workin in a feature that I don't want to be in production yet. The
benefits from that are that I don't touch the master branch to introduce
experimental things.
