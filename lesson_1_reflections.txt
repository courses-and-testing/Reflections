Q: What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

A: You can control whether you want a commit or not, in Google Docs that's not your choice, but a pro of Google Docs is that if you forget to control something Google Docs will make it for you.

Q: Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

A: Because Git is a control version system specially created for code, and they knew that separate files can be related. Google Docs works file level.

Q: How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
